# A Copy Cat of Twin Bee
 Carlos's ICG Practical Project
 
 ## The Plane Model
 This plane's model and materials are all made originally by me in Blender before, so I'm using it for this project.
 
 ## Shaders
 To find the requirements of the shaders, I made a list of things that needs to be compiled:
 - Toon Shading
 - Rim lightning
 - Bump Mapping
 
 I used previously made shaders from the individual project to increase the time of developing.
 
 A LUT is used to give it a warm color, a force shield is created using rim.shader during class.
