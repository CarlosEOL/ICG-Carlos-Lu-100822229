**The Plane Model**

 This plane's model and materials are all made originally by me in Blender before, so I'm using it for this project.
 
 ## Shaders
 To find the requirements of the shaders, I made a list of things that needs to be compiled:
 - Toon Shading x Bump Mapping

 - Rim lightning

 - End
 
 I used previously made shaders from the individual project to increase the time of developing.
 
 A LUT is used to give it a warm color, a force shield is created using rim.shader during class.

Updated the Rim.Shader's Tag by using "Queue" instead of "RenderType" and Upodate the final doc by uploading the final image.

THIS IS THE LAST TIME I'll BE EDITING THIS.
